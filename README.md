# HashTest
HashTest creates a hash table and tests it. First it finds two primes that are off-by-two within a specified range, then it creates a hash table using one prime and a hash function with the other. It uses double hashing.

The purpose of this project was to learn more about hashing and to make a simple implementation of what I learned.
